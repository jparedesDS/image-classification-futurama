## Overview  

This project was part of the **Futurama Kaggle Competition** hosted by Mediavida, focusing on classifying characters in frames from the show.  

Two distinct methodologies were used:  
1. A custom **Keras CNN model** for character identification.  
2. A **ResNet152 model** pretrained with the **Imaginet_v2** dataset.  

Both approaches achieved competitive results, demonstrating robust performance in multi-label image classification tasks.
